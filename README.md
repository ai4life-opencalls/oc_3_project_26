# Project #26: Automatic microtubule doublet picking in tomograms

This project aimed to automatically detect and pick doublets with the correct polarity (i.e., all pointing the same) in Cryo-EM tomograms of cilia.  
Besides the full manual work, another challenge was that the existing software failed to assign polarity correctly.
